<!-- There are two ways to setup -->
<!-- The first way: setup in angular.json -->
<!-- The second way: setup with src https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ngx-scanner-qrcode@latest/wasm/index.js -->
<!-- I recommend using the first method if it doesn't work then switch to the second setup like the example on my stackblitz -->
